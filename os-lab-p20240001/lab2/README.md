## Task Output Files

During the lab, each task redirected its output into `.txt` files. These files are your primary proof of work for the **guided portions** of each task. Make sure all of the following files are present in your `lab2/` folder:

- `task1_basic_navigation.txt`
- `task2_filesystem_exploration.txt`
- `task3_directory_structure.txt`
- `task4_navigation_paths.txt`
- `task5_file_organization.txt`
- `task6_advanced_listing.txt`

## Screenshots

The screenshots below focus on the **Challenge sections** and **command history**, since the guided task outputs are already captured in the `.txt` files above.
